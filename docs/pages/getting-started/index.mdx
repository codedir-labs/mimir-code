# Getting Started

Welcome to Mimir! This guide will help you get up and running quickly.

<Callout type="warning">
  Mimir is currently in active development. Some features may not be fully implemented yet.
</Callout>

## What is Mimir?

Mimir is a platform-agnostic AI coding agent CLI that:

- Works on **Windows, macOS, and Linux**
- Supports **multiple LLM providers** (DeepSeek, Anthropic)
- Uses **your own API keys** (BYOK)
- Provides **Docker sandboxing** for safe code execution
- Includes a **permission system** for security
- Built with **TypeScript** and comprehensive tests

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Node.js 22+** installed
- **npm** or **yarn** package manager
- **(Optional)** Docker Desktop for sandboxed execution
- API keys for your preferred LLM provider (DeepSeek or Anthropic)

## Quick Start

<Steps>

### Install Mimir

```bash
npm install -g mimir-code
```

Or use with npx (no installation required):

```bash
npx mimir-code
```

### Initialize a Project

Navigate to your project directory and initialize Mimir:

```bash
cd your-project
mimir init
```

This creates a `.mimir/` directory with:

- `config.yml` - Configuration file
- `mimir.db` - SQLite database for conversation history

### Configure Your Provider

Edit `.mimir/config.yml` to add your API key:

```yaml
llm:
  provider: deepseek
  apiKey: ${DEEPSEEK_API_KEY} # Or set directly (not recommended)
  model: deepseek-chat
  temperature: 0.7
  maxTokens: 4000
```

Or set via environment variable:

```bash
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

### Start Chatting

```bash
mimir
```

You're ready to go! Try asking:

- "Explain the project structure"
- "Add error handling to the login function"
- "Write unit tests for the API client"
